    @brief Simple layout calculator for scaling and placing GUI elements in their appropriate place.
        Can be used as a template to derive other layout mechanics.

    @note Singleton class as each layout pass shall be stateless for a better view of the layout pipeline.
    @note There is a limitation on using shared_from_this() in the derived classes that inherit UIBase.
        Since UIBase inherits enable_shared_from_this<UIBase>, the shared_from_this() returned when used inside
        a derived class is of type UIBase and it will corrupt the shared/weak ptr control block when trying to do
        sharedParent->getSomethingShared/Weak inside the layout calculator (derived_func(shared_from_this()).
        The workaround for this is to use raw pointers and call the functions with "this" instead of
        "shared_from_this". It is safe anyway as the class doesnt save anything or delete the pointers.

    @note Ex of explained:
        In calculator:
        castedParent->getSomeInternalUinodeshared() => this will crash
                                                            if it was called from derived class with
                                                            parent = shared_from_this

    /** @brief Calculate the computed scale for the elements of this parent element.

        @note This pass needs to be done before the positioning pass.
        @note Slider nodes with scrollbar role are ignored.

        @details Function calculates the required `computedScale` based on the user supplied `scaleType` and
            `value` set via `setScale`. Refer to LayoutBase for more details.
        @details Scaling can be of 4 types: PX, REL, FIT, FILL and FR on each axis. This will determine the computedScale
            of the element.
        @details PX  - Scale of the element expressed in plain pixel values (i.e 50_px)
        @details REL - Scale relative to the parent element and expressed in (0, 1] percentage range (i.e 0.4_rel). The parent
                  element scale is affected by: space taken by scroll bars (if any), padding and borders (of the parent).
                  Additionally, the computedScale of the element will be also affected by the element's margins.
        @details FIT - A Fit element will try to "gift-wrap" around it's OWN child elements such that they fit perfectly inside
                  of the parent. The fit space necessary is increased by the padding and borders of the element itself and by
                  any margins of it's OWN child elements.
                  Constraints for FIT element children on an arbitrary axis:
                    - Cannot be of type FILL/REL as that requires element computedScale to be already know but it's not yet.
                      We try to compute it in FIT.
                    - FIT elements can be FIT on their own but the leaf nodes MUST be of type PX, otherwise it's impossible
                      to find a size to fit around.
        @details FILL - Scale of the element will be an equal part (between it and other fill elements of parent) of what's left
                   after the PX/REL/FIT nodes aquire their computedScale.
                   A FILL element computedScale is affected (shrunk) by it's parent padding and border scale and also by it's
                   own margins.
        @details FR - Scale type specific only for GRID layouts. Grid cell will span exatly "fr" fractional parts. Fractional
                    parts are equal in size and are computed after subtracting all the PX grid cell sizes.
                    Example for column axis:
                        2_fr, 100_px, 1_fr
                    Second cell will occupy exactly 100PX on the X axis.
                    Total fractional parts of the column axis will be: 2_fr + 1_fr = 3_fr.
                    First cell will get 2 parts of the remaining space after subtracting the pixel occupied cells while
                    the third cell will get only 1 part.
                    Simply put the first cell will always be 2 times bigger than the third cell while the second cell remains
                    constant in size.
                    Child elements can be self aligned inside the cell(s) at the following positions via `selfAlign` setting.
                    Child elements can only be of scaleType PX, REL or FILL.
